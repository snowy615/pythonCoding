    """
    simulate a game of racko based on the parameters of input (info, rack, and pile)
    the ultimate goal of the game is to have a hand consisting of numbers from 1 to n be sorted in increasing order
    Description of racko version:
        - there are as many rounds as needed to either win or end up in a state of no more moves (strategy A and B are both not possible or there are no more cards).
        - In either case, the game will end with win or lose with the steps taken.
        - Each round, out of the two methods (A or B), the better of the two yielding an optimal heuristic value will be chosen
        - if hv is the same, A will be the default choice.


    strategy A:
    strategy A designates an acceptable interval of numbers in each slot by determining the range of values.
        Looking through the hand from left to right, the function will look for a slot containing a number that fails to be within the acceptable range.
        Once such a slot is found, function A will be called. The program will attempt to calculate the impact on the heuristic value with card replacement.

        Note: the range of each slot is determined by taking the ceiling of totalCardNumber/totalSlotNumber.
            eg. if there was 20 cards, 7 slots, the range would be 1â€“3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12, 13-15, 16-18, 19-20 (the last slot contains 2 cards because there are no more available cards)

    strategy B:
        Starting at the front of the hand, continue to find 3 consecutive cards that fails to be in ascending order until either one of the conditions is satisfied:
        1. the replacement of one element in the set of 3 numbers allows for the heuristic value of the hand to improve.
        2. there are no more sets of numbers in the hand to change, strategy B will not be taken.
