# map(function, iterable[, iterable1, iterable2,..., iterableN])
# transform different types of Python iterables using map()
# combine map() with other functional tools to perform more complex transformations
# What tools you can use to replace map() and make your code more Pythonic

# ex:
# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# squared = []
# for num in numbers:
#     squared.append(num ** 2)
# print(squared)

for z in range(10, 1000000000000000000, 10):
    print('ha')
    for y in range(12):
        PreviousBalance = 0
        if PreviousBalance <= 0:
            print(z)
            break
